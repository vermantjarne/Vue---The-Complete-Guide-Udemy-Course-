Methods are used for event binding or data binding.
With data binding, every method is executed for every rerender of the component.
Us for events or data that really needs to be reevaluated all the time.

Computed properties are used with data binding.
They are only re-evaluated if one of the used values is changed
They are used for data that depends on other data.

Watchers are not used directly in the template.
They allow running any code in reaction to some changed data (for example, an HTTP request)
These should be used for any non-data update that should be made.
