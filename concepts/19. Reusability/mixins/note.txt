Mixins can allow certain pieces of code to be shared between different components.
This may be important when components, data, methods, etc are shared by various components.
Mixins are especially useful with a functionality like searching, which is similar across multiple components.

A drawback to mixins is that it makes it more complicated to understand code, as the logic is spread out further.
This can be a hurdle for projects where multiple developers are working on components, and multiple mixins are used for a component.
The Composition API makes it more convenient to work on large projects, and provides a solution to this issue.
