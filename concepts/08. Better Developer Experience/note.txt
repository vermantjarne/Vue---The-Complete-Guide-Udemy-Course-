Currently, pages are required to be reloaded whenever any change is made.
Reloading the page also resets the page to the initial state, causing us to lose time.
The auto-completion of the IDE is very limited as well.
We can also only work in just one file or we need to handle multiple files through multiple script imports.

In the vue-test-app, which follows the new setup, a development server is used.
These contain .Vue files, which contain a separate template, script and style section.
