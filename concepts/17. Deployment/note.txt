To make sure the browser can understand the code, it is necessary to build the project.
This can be done easily by making use of scripts.

In the case of this project (and any Vue project made as seen in the course), it contains a 'build' script, to compile it into the dist folder.

To host the web application, we make use of Firebase.
This means the firebase-tools module is also required to be installed.
